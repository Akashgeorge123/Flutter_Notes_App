# notes_app

A Flutter application for creating and managing notes and checklists.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete notes.
- Create checklist-style notes with multiple items.

- Mark checklist items as done/undone.
- Sort checklist items automatically: unfinished items appear first.
- Responsive UI with cards and grids.
